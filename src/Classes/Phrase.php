<?php
/*
Phrase.php to create a Phrase class to handle the phrases

The class must have at least two properties:
  - $currentPhrase a string.
  - $selected an array. Default to an empty array.

The class must include a constructor that accepts two OPTIONAL parameters:
  - $phrase a string, or if empty, get a random phrase
  - $selected an array of selected letters

The class must include the following methods:
  - addPhraseToDisplay(): Builds the HTML for the letters of the phrase. Each letter is presented by an empty box, one list item for each letter. See the example_html/phrase.txt file for an example of what the render HTML for a phrase should look like when the game starts. When the player correctly guesses a letter, the empty box is replaced with the matched letter. Use the class "hide" to hide a letter and "show" to show a letter. Make sure the phrase displayed on the screen doesn't include boxes for spaces: see example HTML.
  - checkLetter(): checks to see if a letter matches a letter in the phrase. Accepts a single letter to check against the phrase. Returns true or false.
